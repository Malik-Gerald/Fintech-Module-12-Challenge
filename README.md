# Fintech-Module-12-Challenge


# Credit Risk Classification

In this project the taks will be to count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.

## Technologies

This project leverages Python 3.9.7 ((default, Sep 16 2021, 16:59:28) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32) with the following packages:
 
* [python](https://www.python.org/) - Official documentation for Python 3.10.5. 
  
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) - Source repository. 
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - Source repository. 
pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

* [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - Source repository. 
The pathlib module offers classes representing filesystem paths with semantics appropriate for different operating systems. Path classes are divided between pure paths, which provide purely computational operations without I/O, and concrete paths, which inherit from pure paths but also provide I/O operations.

* [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) - scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

* [jupyterlab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/urls.html#managing-workspaces-ui) - For information about the jupyter lab remote workspace hosted by a local computer.

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

```
# Install the required libraries
conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn
conda install -c conda-forge pydotplus
```

# Import the required libraries and dependencies
```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
from sklearn.metrics import balanced_accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from imblearn.metrics import classification_report_imbalanced

```

## Usage

The detailed instructions are divided into the following parts:

Use the RandomOverSampler module from the imbalanced-learn library to resample the data. Be sure to confirm that the labels have an equal number of data points.

Use the LogisticRegression classifier and the resampled data to fit the model and make predictions.

1. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance by doing the following:
2. Calculate the accuracy score of the model.
3. Generate a confusion matrix.
4. Print the classification report.

    Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model, fit with oversampled data, predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?
